# 🚀 How It Works

1. User logs in  
2. JWT token is generated  
3. Token is attached to requests  
4. Backend verifies token  
5. Role determines access level  
6. Data is fetched from MongoDB  
7. Admin dashboard visualizes data using charts  
8. Content is filtered securely on backend  

---

# 🧪 Key Functional Scenarios

## Scenario 1 – User Creates Post
- Post saved in MongoDB
- `createdBy` field stores user ID
- Post visible in All Posts
- Post visible in My Posts

## Scenario 2 – Admin Views Dashboard
- Dashboard fetches aggregated data
- Charts render monthly statistics
- Summary cards display metrics

## Scenario 3 – User Clicks My Posts
- Backend filters by `req.user.id`
- Only user-specific content is returned

---

# 🧩 Advanced Concepts Used

- MongoDB Aggregation
- Role-Based Middleware
- Token-Based Authentication
- Protected Routes
- Angular Standalone Components
- Reactive HTTP Requests
- Chart Rendering Lifecycle Handling
